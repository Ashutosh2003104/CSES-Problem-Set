#  CSES Problem Set – Daily Solutions

Welcome to my CSES Problem Set solutions repository.

I am consistently solving **4–5 problems every day** from the CSES Problem Set to strengthen my problem-solving skills and master Data Structures & Algorithms.

This repository reflects my commitment to disciplined practice, continuous improvement, and long-term competitive programming growth.

##  Why CSES?

The CSES Problem Set is one of the most structured and comprehensive collections of competitive programming problems. It covers fundamental and advanced algorithmic concepts that are essential for:

* Technical Interviews
* Competitive Programming
* Core Computer Science understanding
* Logical thinking and optimization skills

Problem Categories Include:

* Introductory Problems
* Sorting and Searching
* Dynamic Programming
* Graph Algorithms
* Tree Algorithms
* Mathematics
* String Algorithms
* Range Queries
* Geometry
* Advanced Techniques

---

##  My Daily Practice Plan

✔ Solve 4–5 problems daily
✔ Focus on writing optimal and clean C++ code
✔ Understand patterns and core logic deeply
✔ Track consistency and progress
✔ Improve speed and accuracy over time

Consistency > Intensity.
